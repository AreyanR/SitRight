## Introduction
**SitRight** is a cross-platform application designed to help you maintain a healthy posture while working on a computer. By using your webcam, SitRight monitors your posture in real-time and provides gentle reminders to sit correctly.

With its easy-to-use interface and minimal resource requirements, SitRight ensures ergonomic habits are as effortless as possible.

## Features
* **Posture Monitoring**: Real-time posture analysis using a webcam
* **Cross-Platform Notifications**: Works seamlessly on macOS and Windows
* **User-Friendly GUI**: Intuitive and modern graphical interface for ease of use

## Installation

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
* Python 3.7 or later installed on your computer
* A working webcam (internal or external)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, download the project files from GitHub. Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/SitRight.git
   cd SitRight
   ```

2. **Set Up Python Environment** (Optional but recommended)  
   Create a virtual environment to keep the project dependencies isolated:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**  
   Install all dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   Launch SitRight by running the main script:
   ```bash
   python sitright.py
   ```

### Troubleshooting
* If you encounter issues, ensure Python is correctly installed by running `python --version`
* On macOS, you may need to grant webcam permissions to the terminal or Python

## Usage

1. **Launch the Application**  
   Run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python sitright.py
   ```

2. **Set Your Reference Posture**
   * Sit upright in your preferred ergonomic posture
   * Press the **B** key in the webcam feed to set this as your baseline

3. **Posture Monitoring**
   * SitRight will monitor deviations from your baseline and notify you when corrections are needed

4. **Quit Monitoring**
   * Press the **Q** key in the webcam feed to stop the session

For detailed instructions, refer to the "How to Use" section in the application.

## How It Works
SitRight uses a webcam to detect and monitor your posture. By taking a snapshot of your optimal sitting position, the application calculates head height and position to track any deviations. Notifications are sent when adjustments are necessary, helping you maintain a healthy posture throughout the day.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required:
* `customtkinter`: For the modern GUI
* `cv2` (OpenCV): To process webcam feeds
* `mediapipe`: For real-time posture detection
* `plyer`: For cross-platform notifications
* `Pillow`: For image handling
* `numpy`: For numerical computations

Install all dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
